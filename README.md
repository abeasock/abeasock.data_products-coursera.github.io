The peer assessed assignment has two parts. First, we need to create a Shiny application and deploy it on Rstudio's servers. Second, we should use Slidify or Rstudio Presenter to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about the application.

Source code for ui.R and server.R files are available on my [GitHub](https://github.com/abeasock/Developing_Data_Products-Coursera)

Slidify presentation for pitching the app is available also available on my [GitHub](https://abeasock.github.io)

The Shiny App is available at: https://amberbeasock.shinyapps.io/project_app/
